      <description>I had to travel to Sweden recently. So probably in 2 hours or so i packed all the necessary things, took my old notebook-bag out of the dusty closet (cleaned it) and packed all the NB-stuff into it. I also included my new KOSS UR-40 headphones in the bag. I have to tell I wasn’tso much impressed when I bought them. You know – in Ukraine if want to know how smth sounds you’ll probably have to buy it first.</description>
