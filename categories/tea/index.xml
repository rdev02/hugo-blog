      <description>Yess and BTW its the Skype shortcut. While on thinking mood guess what would the &amp;#8216;telemonision&amp;#8217; or here in Ukraine &amp;#8216;telemonizor&amp;#8217; would mean? You guessed it right &amp;#8211; a monitor, which has a capability to be come an TV. Why would one need such a thing &amp;#8211; I dunno, but lots and lots of people here want it. I suppose they think that in this way they would spend less money &amp;#8211; but hey &amp;#8211; you would have none: no monitor would be a good TV and no TV would suit you as a nice fast-response monitor, UNLESS it costs more then 2 of them bought separately.</description>

      <description>Now seriously smth HAS to be done about Ukrainian girls reputation in Europe and generally throughout the world. Now I can&amp;#8217;t speak for whole Ukraine but it seems to me that at least Western Ukraine girls are not that money-loving. Today walking to work I saw this
  All this stuff means &amp;#8220;I am a wealthy entrepreneur from USA looking for a nice whore wife from Ukraine aging 19-27&amp;#8243;. Now I&amp;#8217;ve seen this in newspapers and message boards etc.</description>

      <description>THEY ALL SUCK!!! a big deal.
I will start with the last one. Having just recovered from the flu I decided to go to the hospital in order to check if I&amp;#8217;ve totally recovered and that there is nothing &amp;#8220;under the hood&amp;#8221; which would strike me in the back in few days. The normal procedure here is to have a blood analysis and a few more tests. Step one &amp;#8211; find the doctor.</description>

      <title>Ukrainian independence day.</title>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s funny sometimes how could absolutely non-officially connected news be linked together so tightly that one couldn&amp;#8217;t even imagine. Today, reading the daily news I came across an article describing the Barack Obama&amp;#8217;s attitude towards Ukrainian sovereignty along with greetings regarding this year&amp;#8217;s independence day. Between the other it was stated there that &amp;#8220;USA won&amp;#8217;t abandon Ukraine on its way towards democratic future&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Nice words, always pleased to hear/read such things in the mediapress.</description>

      <title>How do they do it?</title>

      <description>It often happens that you have smth. to share with the rest of the world, but you do not have time for it.
&amp;#8220;You do not have time&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; sounds pathetic&amp;#8230; I think it happens more because of the laziness&amp;#8230; yeah definitely. Now I begin to understand why podcasts gain more and more popularity these days &amp;#8211; you do not have to organize links, format text. Find errors, reread the written text in order to find ABSOLUTELY ODD sentences üôÇ  Interesting how do experienced bloggers keep their notes and where&amp;#8230; My last try is google docs.</description>

      <description>Today visited Times. Was interested in one article about (RU+GBR)/UA. To hell the article. I read the comments. OMG.
 OMG again.   &amp;#8220;People, even something that you care for most (democracy?) does not give you the right to lie passionately and ignore facts and invent lies. BTW, Eduard Glushko &amp;#8211; if you are so much afraid of the The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it still can be repaired. Poland has to give back to Germany the territories they got after WW2.</description>

      <description>Recently found myself registered in this wierd system Next In. The most interesting part is I&amp;#8217;ve never made any registrations on this site at all! Looks like those guys&amp;#8217;ve just stolen public info from famous sites like Linked-In. If anyone comes across this one don&amp;#8217;t trust any info they give &amp;#8211; &amp;#8216;case started by stealing i think they will go further. Just want to make official notice of that I have no relation to info that can be found there.</description>
