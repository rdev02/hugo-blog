      <description>Учітеся, брати мої,Учітесь, читайте ,І чужому научайтесь ,Свого не цурайтесь!       [Т. Г. Шевченко]    На днях на очі потрапила чудова стаття, що непогано підсумовує міркування багатьох людей навколо мене(не дарма поширена більше 9 тис. раз). Текст відносно короткий, проте коментарів викликає чимало і, щоб, як то кажуть, &amp;ldquo;три рази не вставати&amp;rdquo;, я вирішив викласти свої коментарі сюди&amp;hellip;
 Але, з початку, невеличкий ліричний відступ :)</description>

      <description>Yess and BTW its the Skype shortcut. While on thinking mood guess what would the ‘telemonision’ or here in Ukraine ‘telemonizor’ would mean? You guessed it right – a monitor, which has a capability to be come an TV. Why would one need such a thing – I dunno, but lots and lots of people here want it. I suppose they think that in this way they would spend less money – but hey – you would have none: no monitor would be a good TV and no TV would suit you as a nice fast-response monitor, UNLESS it costs more then 2 of them bought separately.</description>

      <description>Now seriously smth HAS to be done about Ukrainian girls reputation in Europe and generally throughout the world. Now I can’t speak for whole Ukraine but it seems to me that at least Western Ukraine girls are not that money-loving. Today walking to work I saw this

      <description>THEY ALL SUCK!!! a big deal.I will start with the last one. Having just recovered from the flu I decided to go to the hospital in order to check if I’ve totally recovered and that there is nothing “under the hood” which would strike me in the back in few days. The normal procedure here is to have a blood analysis and a few more tests. Step one – find the doctor.</description>

      <description>It&amp;amp;#8217;s funny sometimes how could absolutely non-officially connected news be linked together so tightly that one couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t even imagine. Today, reading the daily news I came across an article describing the Barack Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s attitude towards Ukrainian &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-family: -webkit-monospace;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;sovereignty along with greetings regarding this year&amp;amp;#8217;s independence day. Between the other it was stated there that &amp;amp;#8220;USA won&amp;amp;#8217;t abandon Ukraine on its way towards democratic future&amp;amp;#8230;&amp;amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Recently found myself registered in this wierd system Next In. The most interesting part is I’ve never made any registrations on this site at all! Looks like those guys’ve just stolen public info from famous sites like Linked-In. If anyone comes across this one don’t trust any info they give – ‘case started by stealing i think they will go further. Just want to make official notice of that I have no relation to info that can be found there.</description>
