      <description>I had to travel to Sweden recently. So probably in 2 hours or so i packed all the necessary things, took my old notebook-bag out of the dusty closet (cleaned it) and packed all the NB-stuff into it. I also included my newÂ KOSS UR-40 headphones in the bag. I have to tell I wasn&amp;#8217;tso much impressed when I bought them. You know &amp;#8211; in Ukraine if want to know how smth sounds you&amp;#8217;ll probably have to buy it first.</description>
