      <description>It started as an innocent idea concluding my 2022 Canada ski trip: what if we went to Japan for ski trip, instead of Canada? Indeed, sometimes the border crossing and car travel time would amount to a length of a direct SEA-&amp;gt;HND. Japan was locked for travel at the time and we decided to commit to it softly, putting little hope on this actually coming to fruition.
Lo and behold: mid 2022 fall Japan has re-opened for tourism and the place we booked for stay did not go out of business because of Covid.</description>

      <description>Amazing. Yes it was really amazing. I traveled with my darling Anya and I didn&amp;amp;#8217;t expect it that good especially keeping in mind that we had to go with a 4 star hotel. However it was really nice and if you consider going to Turkey with a low budget &amp;amp;#8211; I would recommend [Kosdere Exclusive][1](the place we stayed in). First thing I have to mention is our tour agency [Tez Tour][2].</description>

      <description>I had to travel to Sweden recently. So probably in 2 hours or so i packed all the necessary things, took my old notebook-bag out of the dusty closet (cleaned it) and packed all the NB-stuff into it. I also included my new KOSS UR-40 headphones in the bag. I have to tell I wasn’tso much impressed when I bought them. You know – in Ukraine if want to know how smth sounds you’ll probably have to buy it first.</description>
