 <span style="white-space:pre"></span><span style="font-family: -webkit-monospace; font-size: 17px; ">Now you never know how will modern technology strike you next time&#8230; Experience I&#8217;ve got today is remarkable. It&#8217;s not that something awful happened, but potentially this is really serious. Imagine you have a template in the phone to send SMS quickly with predefined text. And Imagine this piece of software has bugs&#8230; Whatever &#8211; one might think if it won&#8217;t send an sms &#8211; Iâ€™ll retype and sent it again. Now the real trouble comes when it sends sms far more then once. And it becomes even worse if an sms you send is a special one&#8230; a service one&#8230; designed to pay for services using you credit card. And then when you realize that the amount of money withdrawn from you account is not expected N but M*N, where M is a random bug number you look like that smiley. And you can&#8217;t blame anyone(providers are innocent &#8211; they got m requests and thoroughly fulfilled &#8217;em) &#8211; &#8217;cause you&#8217;re afraid to reproduce and hope it won&#8217;t ever reproduce. So watch-out for new technology &#8211; sometimes it knocks you down.</span>
