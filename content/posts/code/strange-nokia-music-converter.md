The nice thing about all Noka phones is that they simply work. No excuses. But seems like putting lts of effort into the phone firmware leaves very little to the supporting software these phones are shipped with. There is a really nice piece of software called &#8220;Nokia PC Suite&#8221;. Though it is 80% useless to my mind it has always been a pleasure for me to know I can manage utmost every feature in my phone throught that shiny UI. I can, but, in some cases I&#8217;d better not:) The funniest feture out of this suit is Nokia Music Transfer. Along with smart logic buit in wasting your disk space it has a nice(at first glance) feature of converting your mp3/whatever tracks into optimized aac/aac+ format. Perfect one may think untill he/she uses it in practice. I got various &#8220;sound effects&#8221; starting from speediing up the tempo, loosing framents of audio and music distortion and ending up with gaining file size(but you expect it to shrink and the format suggests&#8230;). Well I have still managed one positive feature &#8211; you can copy your media and organize playlists inside it, which in fact works pretty good(but you can use File manager for that purpose quite easilly too AND without creation of tonns of folders on your media card, but that a whole another story&#8230;). Hope Noka guys would fix it in comming updates &#8217;cause it&#8217;s&#8230; not even annoying &#8211; it&#8217;s funny:)

  BTW &#8211; the update manager software works perfect(at least for me) too;)
