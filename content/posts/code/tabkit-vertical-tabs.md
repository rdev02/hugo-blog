A post for those who, once tried, cannot live without vertical tabs in FF.
  
I used to have [TabKit ][1]installed but this unfortunately does not support FF 4. So I even was very reluctant to switch to the new version as having my browsing (or should I say _research ) _organized,  __is one of the crucial parts of my productivity. But turns out there is [Vertical Tabs][2] which does almost the same thing. It&#8217;s not that polished as TabKit but it &#8220;does the thing&#8221; and so far I&#8217;m happy with it.

UPD: Found the [VertTabBar][3] addon also while writing this post&#8230; might suite someone more.
