    Finally. Now frankly &#8211; preparing for MS exams while doing die-hard java is not a funny thing to do. NEVER practice such a combination&#8230;
  
    About the exam &#8211; it was better then the previous 2: it obeyed no rules:). What I mean here is that I could have skipped the preparation kit completely! Yes there were a few questions related to the book&#8217;s content, BUT reading it is completely optional IMHO. Even more &#8211; you&#8217;ll be fine if you just skim through the chapter headings and introductions. 
  
    About the questions &#8211; **common sense required. **They are all about common sense. If you developed the apps and know how things are working there &#8211; answers are obvious. Of course there are a few &#8220;do it the MS way&#8221; questions, but most of &#8217;em &#8211; common sense and logic job. So my advise &#8211; schedule for Tuesday morning.
  
   And the last one &#8211; free certificates are over &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to order one now if you want. Looks like taking those exams has to be lightning fast, but when would you do work then? So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m quitting with MS certification until I get .NET related stuff to do at work again. Heading to SCJP now:) Wish me luck&#8230;
