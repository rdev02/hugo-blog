Installed, played with it a bit&#8230; Looks nice ðŸ™‚  
Among significant pluses(IMHO of course):

  * smoother experience
  * nice improved and thought out UI
  * sms log deserves additional applause (clap)(clap)(clap)
  * back(PC->phone) synchronization improved(both speed and reliability)
  * working(at last) maps(NavTech)

  among things I miss:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      full control over the phone&#8217;s file system
    </li>
    <li>
      application install
    </li>
    <li>
      media(other then mp3) transfer
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
        But for those the are great news: Good ol&#8217; PC Suite is not removed with Ovi upgrade ðŸ™‚ So you can still use it if you wish to&#8230;

        Generally Ovi is a much better tool for daily sync then PC Suite was. I literally enjoy using it. And most of the PC Suite functionality preserved.

        I didn&#8217;t use the Ovi store &#8211; the main purpose of all this thing :):):) but I used maps service and it is pretty decent. Keeping in mind that you can download the maps for different regions and upload them to your mobile beforehand makes it a very useful thing, specially if you have a gen5 Nokia.
