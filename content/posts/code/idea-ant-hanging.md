I had a very &#8216;uncomfortable&#8217; issue with Idea when using it for ant builds &#8211; it hang in certain places like jar update task, rename task or similar.
  
All my struggle can be found on [Idea track][1]. Fortunately Carl Abramsson found a workaround for that issue using

> -noinput 

switch to ant launch. Now everything works like a charm. Decided to create this post in case some one will be desperately googling for a solution in the wrong place ðŸ™‚
