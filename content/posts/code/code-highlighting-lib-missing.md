Yesterday tried to post some code to my technical blog again. What a painfull process was that! Never thought it would be so hard to add some custom javascript to my template. If Google validates input so hard why won&#8217;t they create some custom tag for code? I think many people use code posts in blogger but as far as i&#8217;ve seen all of them look pretty bad. [Live space  
][1] looks much better in that perspective&#8230; Hope this would be somehow solved soon&#8230;
