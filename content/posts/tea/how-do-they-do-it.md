  It often happens that you have smth. to share with the rest of the world, but you do not have time for it. 

<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
  &#8220;You do not have time&#8221;&#8230; sounds pathetic&#8230; I think it happens more because of the laziness&#8230; yeah definitely. Now I begin to understand why podcasts gain more and more popularity these days &#8211; you do not have to organize links, format text. Find errors, reread the written text in order to find ABSOLUTELY ODD sentences ðŸ™‚

     Interesting how do experienced bloggers keep their notes and where&#8230; My last try is <a href="http://docs.google.com/">google docs</a>. Though a friend of mine says it not a stable system &#8211; I already use it for some plain text storing and it has never failed. It&#8217;s really convenient, if you&#8217;re online of course:)
