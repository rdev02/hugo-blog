    It&#8217;s funny sometimes how could absolutely non-officially connected news be linked together so tightly that one couldn&#8217;t even imagine. Today, reading the daily news I came across an article describing the Barack Obama&#8217;s attitude towards Ukrainian <span style="font-family: -webkit-monospace;"><span style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;">sovereignty along with greetings regarding this year&#8217;s independence day. Between the other it was stated there that &#8220;USA won&#8217;t abandon Ukraine on its way towards democratic future&#8230;&#8221;. Nice words, always pleased to hear/read such things in the mediapress. </span></span></span></span>  
<span style="font-family: -webkit-monospace;"><span style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;">    But this wasn&#8217;t the article that made me write this post. That article arrived 15 minutes later. And it was about&#8230; guess what? &#8211; Dmitry Medvedev&#8217;s greetings about Ukrainian independence day! ðŸ™‚ It has to be mentioned that earlier NATO officially stated that they won&#8217;t engage in any conflicts regarding Ukrainian territory and borders&#8230;.</span></span></span></span>  
    So, what was that? A mere coincidence? For me it feels like it wasn&#8217;t. Anyways &#8211; there are things to think over. And over. IMHO nice that I&#8217;m living in Lviv, which is more far away from Russia then most of the cities in Ukraine, very nice.
