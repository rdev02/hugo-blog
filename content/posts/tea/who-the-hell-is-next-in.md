Recently found myself registered in this wierd system [Next In][1]. The most interesting part is I&#8217;ve never made any registrations on this site at all! Looks like those guys&#8217;ve just stolen public info from famous sites like [Linked-In][2]. If anyone comes across this one don&#8217;t trust any info they give &#8211; &#8216;case started by stealing i think they will go further. Just want to make official notice of that I have no relation to info that can be found there. Thing like that make me so frustrated!
