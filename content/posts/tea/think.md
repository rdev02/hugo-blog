Yess and BTW its the Skype shortcut. While on thinking mood guess what would the &#8216;telemonision&#8217; or here in Ukraine &#8216;telemonizor&#8217; would mean? You guessed it right &#8211; a monitor, which has a capability to be come an TV. Why would one need such a thing &#8211; I dunno, but lots and lots of people here want it. I suppose they think that in this way they would spend less money &#8211; but hey &#8211; you would have none: no monitor would be a good TV and no TV would suit you as a nice fast-response monitor, UNLESS it costs more then 2 of them bought separately. Then what&#8217;s the fuss about I ask?! And yet another day someone comes and asks- could you advice a nice monitor? You tell smth from your own experience, and they hear smth like &#8211; &#8220;Oh but it&#8217;s too small to be a nice TV&#8221;. god damn &#8211; you asked about the monitor &#8211; not the TV set, or I lost it somewhere? And the story repeats all over again with different things : PcBox(nice workstation PC + XBox), Cameraphone&#8230;etc. Last one seems to be a well known product already.. for all those telemonision-lovers out there. Poor people I must say.
