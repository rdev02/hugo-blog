I had to travel to Sweden recently. So probably in 2 hours or so i packed all the necessary things, took my old notebook-bag out of the dusty closet (cleaned it) and packed all the NB-stuff into it. I also included my new  [KOSS UR-40][1] headphones in the bag. I have to tell I wasn&#8217;tso much impressed when I bought them. You know &#8211; in Ukraine if want to know how smth sounds you&#8217;ll probably have to buy it first. Well they were better than an average headset but still I considered my old [Panasonic HG50][2] to sound softer even if they didn&#8217;t catch some low levels.

  So as I pointed out, I took all my stuff and started off for the journey. It took me 2 flights to get to Sweden and, as a result 4 X-ray checks on my luggage. Tired to death I reached the hotel at 9 PM and after a brief shower decided to listen to smth good before I get to sleep. I put my headphones on, launch winamp, brose for smth and &#8211; oh my goodness! What a perfect sound! At first I didn&#8217;t believe it were my new UR-40&#8230; but then I thought it can&#8217;t be my old Panasonic one&#8217;s  -they cant catch that tiny sound&#8230; Finally I realized smth must have happened to my KOSS. I dunno what and I dunno why, but now they sound a lot better. Still not worth the money I paid but close to it.

  So whenever you have a bad headset &#8211; try putting it through an X-ray – and maybe they&#8217;ll get better too;)
