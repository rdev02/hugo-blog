Today visited [Times][1]. Was interested in [one article][2] about (RU+GBR)/UA. To hell the article. I read the comments. OMG. 

<div>
  OMG again.
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;<span   style="  line-height: 14px; font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;">People, even something that you care for most (democracy?) does not give you the right to lie passionately and ignore facts and invent lies. BTW, Eduard Glushko &#8211; if you are so much afraid of the The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it still can be repaired. Poland has to give back to Germany the territories they got after WW2. Ukraine has to democratically shrink to the pre-war size. How&#8217;bout that?<span   style="  line-height: normal; font-family:Georgia;font-size:16px;">&#8220;</span></span>
</div>

<div>
  One of the posts there. It got normal replies. thoughtful replies. Let me show you one more:
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;<span   style="  line-height: 14px; font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;">So the Times still thinks Russia is the agressor in the Russia-Georgia war? As an Ukrainia citizen I want to say that most Ukrainians don&#8217;t want NATO, they want to head towards Russia. About the Russia-Georgia war, its old news. Everybody knows who the agressor was. Imagine Russia estblishing a pro-Russian government in Mexico and then training and equiping Mexicans with Russian military hardware, and then Mexico attacks Americans in Texas. EXACTLY the same situation, only from an other point of view.</span>

<div>
  Makes me think Ukraine has got another <i>IT </i>president. &#8220;Long live the King&#8221;. Or at least a &#8220;spare&#8221; minister of foreign affairs.
</div>

<div>
  What&#8217;s <span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#333333;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language: RU;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">frightening </span>is that no one replies. Now imagine Europeans or other reading this post. What do they think? I think you&#8217;ve got the idea. Horrible.
</div>

<div>
  I never paid too much attention to the saying the Ukraine looses the &#8220;IT war&#8221; with Russia every day, but I think we all should. Regularly.
</div>

<div>
  I know it&#8217;s a common ukrainian habit &#8211; sit on the ass doing nothing till someone comes and hits you in the face, but times change fast and some habits just have to get lost, or we will get lost with them.
