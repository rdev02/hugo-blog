Now seriously smth HAS to be done about Ukrainian girls reputation in Europe and generally&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;the world. Now I can&#8217;t speak for whole Ukraine but it seems to me that at least Western Ukraine girls are not that money-loving. Today walking to work I saw this 

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a>
</div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  All this stuff means &#8220;I am a wealthy&nbsp;entrepreneur from&nbsp;USA looking for a nice <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">whore</span>&nbsp;wife from Ukraine aging 19-27&#8243;. Now I&#8217;ve seen this in newspapers and message boards etc. But on billboard???!!! I think they have crossed the line with this. Where is the Ukrainian MFA looking? It ruined my day..
