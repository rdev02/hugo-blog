&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Amazing. Yes it was really amazing. I&nbsp;traveled&nbsp;with my darling Anya and I didn&#8217;t expect it that good especially keeping in mind that we had to go with a 4 star hotel. However it was really nice and if you consider going to Turkey with a low budget &#8211; I would recommend&nbsp;[Kosdere Exclusive][1](the place we stayed in).  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First thing I have to mention is our tour agency&nbsp;[Tez Tour][2]. Everywhere we went we saw their&nbsp;buses/representatives that were very friendly and helpful. You could get any info|support you needed and always with a cheerful smile. Of course they most of the personnel in the hotel understands/speaks&nbsp;English buy it way more convenient if there is someone that can explain smth to you using your native language.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing worth mentioning the Turkish people standard of living. When I was planning to visit this country I believed Ukraine is far more strong both economically and ethically. But when I actually talked to people there and listened to what they say interesting facts turned out. One of the things that impressed me the most(and I&#8217;ve seen the proof of it by my very own eyes) &#8211; the&nbsp;absence&nbsp;of crime on the streets. If the shop owner wants to close the shop he/she simply hangs a big peace of fabrics over the shop-front and that&#8217;s it! Nothing gets stolen. Unf&#8230;believable. Also the country takes good care of people, provides free education and has a good well-formed and modern army. BTW half of the country&#8217;s budget goes to army needs. Another interesting thing is that an average wedding in Turkey has >500 invitees. And the ones that are held in the&nbsp;countryside have more than 1200 invitees. And all these people know each other.&nbsp;The population of the country is twice as ours and I believe their economy is twice as strong&#8230; They produce perfect cars, textile and have a well developed&nbsp;tourism(although it gives them only 5% of their country&#8217;s income).

&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of course, the sea. I visited the&nbsp;Mediterranean seashore. The water there is so salty then why you dry-up&nbsp;after swimming you can collect salt from your skin. This fact makes it very easy to swim even with one hand:). the water is blue and somewhere at 6:30 AM it looks totally white(due to lots of salt). 26-28 degrees above zero in the water makes you wanna never come out to the shore.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; A few words about the weather.&nbsp;The first day when we arrived I was struck by the heat and the amount of moisture int the air. To my great relief the conditioner in our room was working regardless of the key-lock present, so I whenever I returned back to my hotel room I could have a fresh breath. But the mediterranian sea was great so I din&#8217;t visit my hotel room often :). And later, when I had already got used to the worm climate there sometimes in the evening I even felt a bit cold(and the conditioner was used then hardly once a day for a few hours).  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another &nbsp;nice thing was the local food. In the hotel restaurant you could find everything: different meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, junk-food:). I think it could meat anyone&#8217;s needs and tastes. Also turkish delight and sherbet are definitely worth trying.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course it is a bit&nbsp;weird to see palms instead of oaks and beeches, swarthy people all around you and most drinks for 1$, but I really think this country is worth visiting again.
