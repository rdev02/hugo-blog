You can&#8217;t really work with all of that technology at once to keep all the names of classes and methods in your head, and the projects are swapping fast&#8230; SO it took me more than a year to get from an idea of sitting an axam to actually passing it.

  If anyone interested &#8211; during the exam  found out that Self-paced training kit is a big deal in preparation for this exam. I even noticed a few questions right from the preparation tests. The rime was far more than enough. The survey that followed the exam was probably half the time :). So generally it&#8217;s not hard and it&#8217;s a good experience&#8230;
