    Â  Â  In my previous post I was rambling about<a href="https://blog.vnomad.com/seagate-blackarmor-nas-400/" target="_blank"> Seagate BlackArmor </a>and my sad experience with it. Apart from the sadness it also has my initial thoughts and requirements, so I won&#8217;t duplicate them in this one. But, to keep consistent with the previous review I&#8217;ll go with the same headings/experience areas. That being said &#8211; here we go!

    Â  Â  Half a year has passed and I&#8217;ve been using Synology NAS for all this time. I ordered it from Amazon and off it came right in the delivery timeframes, ready for my experiments and scrutiny.
  </div>
  
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">
    Packaging and build quality.
  </h4>
  
  <div>
    Â  Â  I couldn&#8217;t be impressed more. Apple usually is a master in packaging their products, but these guys(synology) can stand up the competition. Everything in the box was perfectly packed a secured in a very little amount of space yet preserving a pleasant unpacking experience. One of the nice things is &#8211; when I was moving I managed to pack it with the box I saved just as if it was never unpackaged. Somehow they thought out the packaging in a way you use all the parts, perfectly seal the device and accessories and you have no junk left:) &#8211; KUDOS!
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Â  Â  Build is a step up from the aforementioned NAS. All the parts that were plastic in seagate are metallic in synology. The drive bay has 2 solid fans and the drives themselves are secured inside the bay with bolts. Accessing the drives is also not that easy &#8211; you have to unscrew 4 bolts at the back, lower the back panel with fans and then get to the drives. This is not as convenient as seagate&#8217;s open-dorr-click-and-take-away system, but how often do you actually want to replace drives inside your NAS? ðŸ˜‰
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Â  Â Other then that Synology is about the same size and noise, although heavier(due to metal parts). Move on to usage:)

  <h4 style="text-align: left;">
    UI and Software.
  </h4>
  
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    Â  Â  It comes with <a href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/index.php?lang=us" target="_blank">DSM 4.2</a>. Usually, when you log into the web interface you would expect some semi-lame web app that&#8217;ll link you to the features of your device. Not the case! Not even close! DSM web interface if one of the most(in not just the most) advanced web interfaces I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s all ajax and feels like a fine-tuned linux window manager. you literally have a web-like sort-of OS, working on your NAS giving you full control over it. Pages can be written about all the possibilities you have with the built in apps and there&#8217;s even more with thirds party packages. Literally, everything I might have thought/dreamed about that I could combine/use NAS for &#8211; is already there. With a nice, multitasking, rich intuitive and responsive interface. I won&#8217;t go into much details about the apps &#8211; there&#8217;s just too many of them to cover and each and every of them deserves good comments. Those who want to learn more &#8211; I welcome you to use link I mentioned a couple lines up.
  </div>
  
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    Â  Â In 6 months I&#8217;ve never seen any app crash or misbehave. Neither did I see any hardware faults or reboots. Stable. Reliable.
  </div>
  
  <h4 style="text-align: left;">
    The worx.
  </h4>
  
  <div>
    I did the same tests, that I had done for the previous NAS. They all showed good consistent results, so I went on started configuring and placing my data on it. For some reason new apps did not want to install to second partition, so I had to use the first one for all the apps and the second one for all other stuff which was not my initial plan. Whatever. I checked the read/write speeds and they were almost at what the specs were saying. Later I tested out 2 simultanious clients accessing 1080p video from the device, while one other device was listing pictures from it. They all showed decent performance and that is probably the biggest load I&#8217;ll ever put on this device. So in general &#8211; it worx:).

  <h4 style="text-align: left;">
    The problems.
  </h4>
  
  <div>
    I did not have them:) There was one problem I had not being able to set up Glacier backup from my NAS after I moved. But luckily they do have <a href="http://forum.synology.com/enu/" target="_blank">support forums</a>Â which helped me understand that my time was not synchronized. After I fixed the time issue everything worked like a charm.

    <p>
      It costs around 2.5 times more than seagate, but I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth every penny I paid. In fact I was so happy with my purchase that I spread the word around and now a couple of my friends also have similar setups. And neither of them is unhappy. These boxes just work, so far.<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">*all pictures are referenced fromÂ </span><a href="http://www.synology.com/">www.synology.com</a>
