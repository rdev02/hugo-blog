&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One step forward to MCPD. To my mind there is not that much to pass in this exam(MCPD) &#8211; it&#8217;s like a combination of the previous 2 with some logic included- &nbsp;not just simple development components.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the exam &#8211; not much can be said. Only one thing is worth mentioning &#8211; it feels like not everything in this exam is covered by the training kit. Of course I can be wrong, but still feels like it is&#8230; Interesting how would the next one go&#8230;
