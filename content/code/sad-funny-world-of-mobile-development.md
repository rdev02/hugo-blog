      Being a &#8216;mobile&#8217; developer is definitely fun. Although sometimes, when you think about it &#8216;deeper&#8217; you&#8217;d rather drink a pint of whiskey:). Take a look at the enterprise Symbian OS:

  Reliable, huh? ðŸ˜‰ And it&#8217;s not just Symbian &#8211; in my point of view it&#8217;s MIDP itself. You just can&#8217;t rely on it unless you test, test and once again &#8211; test. For me it feels like implementation usually just do not care about about what does the specification say. Things just DO NOT WORK&#8230; although documented that they should. Taking into account that there are tons of different devices out there your development might just drive you crazy. For example <a href="http://developer.sonyericsson.com/community/message/128778#128778">this issue</a> haven&#8217;t ever been resolved so far.

     We are moving to mobile applications fast and I hope many things would change soon, for developing Products with all the &#8216;stuff&#8217; we have available now&#8230; it&#8217;s bit&#8230; em&#8230; unreliable. If not worse. I&#8217;m not talking here about mobile games or some sparky screensaver &#8211; this can do fine even now.

     But it&#8217;s still interesting &#8211; you&#8217;re back into time when you had to count every single byte of memory you use and expect that environment &#8220;doesn&#8217;t really like those guys here&#8221;. SO that&#8217;s a bit of a challenge and it definitely makes you &#8220;programing understanding&#8221; better.
