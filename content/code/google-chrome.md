Now that this fancy prog is available i downloaded and installed it hoping to see all that Google promised it will have. However either &#8217;cause its beta or these things just cant be fixed for browsers &#8211; here &#8216;s my opinion after about half a moth usage.  
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Usability</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&#8211; good, except if one tab hangs &#8211; all tabs entire app hang&#8230;After some time however you get a dialog requesting the stop of some plugin, but in general &#8211; if there is no active items on the page &#8211; it just hangs üôÅ  
I can&#8217;t say i experieced tremendous change after moving from firefox. I almost never use drag-tab-out feature. As for me it would be much better to have some kind of tab-grouping mechanism &#8217;cause having lots of instances of chrome in my task bar doesnt really make me happy.  
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Safety</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&#8211; good, when I came to page with harmful script it took me one checkbox to get rid of the page. Certificate management also good but I haven&#8217;t found a funtion to add exceptions &#8211; maybe there will be one in final version. The one thing i want to mention is &#8211; I was amazed about how easily it grabbed all my passwords from firefox &#8211; is it so easy to do or I have missed something&#8230;. [Agreement issue][1] is also one thing to keep in mind.  
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Stability</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&#8211; rather good than bad. After long period of time it still becomes sluggish as any other browser. Especially if there are lots of tabs open. Today i had an issue with google reader: i listened to some podcasts via reader and then after some switching in preferences the just refused to play though download bar was progressing&#8230; What was the most <span style="font-style: italic;">interesting part</span> is that closing the tab and opening it didn&#8217;t help. How does it connects with the super-separate process concept ;)? Error messages ala &#8216;Sorry error happened&#8217; are not even worth mentioning.

So to sum up: Chrome is is a very pleasant browser to use but now it doesnt seem to liverage all the problems that it is said to. Commercials are good but reality bytes&#8230;  
Happy browsing!
