    Now that I wrote lots of &#8216;bad&#8217; stuff about this new community version &#8211; time to write something fine, as I really enjoy developing in this IDE.
  
   First of all I downloaded a new 90.193 version and noticed that UI issues are all fixed in it. Although my &#8216;more serious&#8217; still reproduce this is something pleasant, indicating that the work is in progress and I&#8217;m sure all the other stuff will be fixed soon.
  
   Another thing I wanted to tell is a lil&#8217; story about how IDE can save &#8216;ur time. I gave a task to my co-developer to clean-up the Constants class of all the unnecessary constants we had. there was quite a rush some time before and we didn&#8217;t have time to think over renaming and finding the &#8216;correct match&#8217;. Using Eclipse it took 3-4 hours looking ant every single constant and drilling through the code to find usages. Ok. Today I opened the file with my Idea community and guess what I saw? Right &#8211; 9 constants in different places reported having no usage at all. How much time did I spend? Probably a second  &#8211; to open the file, all the rest had been done by Idea&#8230; And this is just one of the cases.
  
    So I&#8217;ll continue using this community version and try to contribute to it as much as I can, for it definitely makes me more productive.
