      <title>DiskTest in go and Synology NAS</title>

      <description>Back in 2013 I got myself a Synology DS413j, which has proven to be a reliable companion for me though these 7 years. I used it for file backup, media streaming and as a TimeMachine destination pretty successfully. Any such station needs good drives to provide value, and drives, as many of us know, are pretty unreliable. In 7 years I replaced about 6: 2 were bad right after arrival, and another 4 went bad as the years went by.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rare that a blog has 0 images. Hosting them on the same box as the blog instance is the easiest solution, but it comes at a cost: disk space and page load speed. Unless you are a professional blogger, you are also not ready shell out many $$ for a CDN, so what options are there?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago my blog was hosted on a 10$/mo vps instance in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com&#34;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a couple docker containers, running an ever dynamic &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; platform. Now it&amp;rsquo;s completely static, served from &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; servers free. What follows is a small experience reco/guide on how to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In my previous post I was rambling aboutSeagate BlackArmor and my sad experience with it. Apart from the sadness it also has my initial thoughts and requirements, so I won&amp;#8217;t duplicate them in this one. But, to keep consistent with the previous review I&amp;#8217;ll go with the same headings/experience areas. That being said &amp;#8211; here we go!    DSJ413j     Half a year has passed and I&amp;#8217;ve been using Synology NAS for all this time.</description>

      <description>So I decided that I&amp;#8217;m sick and tired of plugging in and out usb drives. Be it my tiny 16GB daily thumb drive, or store-it-all 2TB external seagate &amp;#8211; this is a pain&amp;#8230; And to make sure everything is stored you have to &amp;#8220;detach/remove&amp;#8221; them safely all the time. And than eventually you need more storage(or will need) and expanding this kind of solution means more devices OR significantly more money.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m dealing a lot with javascript nowadays and obviously I have to take performance into account. One way of doing this is writing a bunch of test code and record the time for your scripts, but what if you wanted to quickly test out some approaches and do not really want to invest a lot into them? Today I was pointed to a solution: http://jsperf.com/. This awesome tool does not just give you the framework to easily test out javascript but also provides and already created library of tests other people created when investigating their performance issues.</description>

      <description>It has been a few month since I started mangling with WP7 platform. The more I learnt about it from the inside the more I wanted to buy new real WP7 phone. Things changed slightly after I have done my very first app(didn&amp;#8217;t make it to the app store as I found plenty of similar ones already there and mine was not adding much :() but still as of now I would really be interested in posessing a WP7 phone and giving it a solid try.</description>

      <description>Recently had to do an investigation about MySql server performance. So what I basically did was: created a winXP wmWare image, created a script for generating populating sql; installed db server version on that machine and kept track of times while executing sql statements; reverted to the original virgin machine state; start again. The versions I tested on were MySql community server 5.1, 5.5 and the development verion of 5.6. Here is the chart that represents my findings[the smaller the better]:</description>

      <description>If you’re in the same trouble as I was with black screen during boot(plymouth has the theme installed and even displays it during shutdown) then there is a small thing that has to be edited in order to get rid of this annoyance. Go to
 /etc/grub.d/10_linux
 and remove the **handoff=7 **parameter. Inspired by this and also this(pretty nice tool for configuring plymouth for dummies).</description>

      <description>Spent about 3 hours trying to install the latest java ee sdk on my natty narwhal with no luck. It usually hang with 45% and 5seconds left forever. Might be I’m a bad googler but turned out that there is a bug in the installer which prevents the installation from continuing. The workaround is to disable the network connections before the installation begins(disabling while it is hanging did not work for me).</description>

      <description>A post for those who, once tried, cannot live without vertical tabs in FF.
I used to have TabKit installed but this unfortunately does not support FF 4. So I even was very reluctant to switch to the new version as having my browsing (or should I say _research ) _organized, __is one of the crucial parts of my productivity. But turns out there is Vertical Tabs which does almost the same thing.</description>

      <description>Internet is basically full of subj but vice-versa(BlazeDS to java). So the problem I had was that when the object is “translated” from java via BlazeDS to flex application it had NAN’s in the double fields. The transfer object was a simple POJO I passed via the interface. First thing I checked were the getters – all present and valid. I took quite a lot of time till we figured out that it was the missing setters which made the code malfunction.</description>

      <description>Now really, what would be faster/more reliable for a typical not so complicated and not over-simple case? Yes the one we tend to deal with in our day-to-day work? For those impatient benchmarks are here.Reading a 100/1000-line file is not fun and I really think you shouldn’t bother choosing if you’re dealing with such volumes of data. But if you have to parse 320k-500k records lines, which, in fact, is not that large – 320k of CSV data is ~ 12MB performance is considerable.</description>

As I mentioned before – nice piece of software if we forget about all the “store” thing. But it has one important for me thing missing – sms extracting mechanism. You can’t just take all of your sms and store to the file you want.</description>

Though some of the properties might be scattered through different classes like Environment and *Info and even *Stream and more(and I believe accessing them through that places is significantly cheaper and faster) there’s one sigle silver bullet to get them all via

      <description>Consider some UI that you would like to present as tabs. And you also know that all these tabs would have a considerate amount of code in common. There are some thoughts [here][1] but those are more about visual representation. Also creating usercontrols I believe is not an option due to it&amp;amp;#8217;s not expected to have more tah one tab of a kind. The solution has to both utilize the VS designer(otherwise tab creation would take considerably more time) and keep the code separate from the tabcontrol &amp;amp;#8211; holder form.</description>

      <description>There is a nice tutorial here on how to create spring web services using jax-b. Works just fine but it’s hell lots of issues you would run into while making it actually work. The most frustrating for me as of today was the absence of Jaxb2Marshaller. in the std “spring-ws-core” artifact package. It’s just not there and noone would tell you. Only _**Jaxb1Marshaller **_is. After an hour googling found this (BTW very simple and straightforward) post where spotted the “spring-oxm-tiger” artifact.</description>

It might be anything from invalid jad to signing problems. The one I&amp;amp;#8217;m going to describe here is when the size of the cod file is more than 64K.  Finding out if you have this problem is fairly easy: just look into the final cod and see if there are actually 2 cod files packaged in one cod.</description>

All my struggle can be found on Idea track. Fortunately Carl Abramsson found a workaround for that issue using
 -noinput
 switch to ant launch. Now everything works like a charm. Decided to create this post in case some one will be desperately googling for a solution in the wrong place 🙂</description>

      <description>Installed, played with it a bit… Looks nice 🙂
Among significant pluses(IMHO of course):
 smoother experience nice improved and thought out UI sms log deserves additional applause (clap)(clap)(clap) back(PC-&amp;gt;phone) synchronization improved(both speed and reliability) working(at last) maps(NavTech)   among things I miss:     full control over the phone&amp;#8217;s file system   application install   media(other then mp3) transfer    But for those the are great news: Good ol&amp;#8217; PC Suite is not removed with Ovi upgrade 🙂 So you can still use it if you wish to&amp;#8230;   Generally Ovi is a much better tool for daily sync then PC Suite was.</description>

      <description>Quite a time ago had to do this but had no time for posting a complete solution. Read a few articles on that so that I got the idea. Although it looks quite simple you might run into several configuration issues firing weird and long stacktraces. To get rid of those I&amp;amp;#8217;ll describe the way it worked for me with some additional comments. First of all lets assume we use JBoss app server.</description>

      <description>Those of you who use devenv for building VS solutions(although you are discouraged to [here][1]) might get into trouble if your solution has more than 1 project and it takes quite a time building both. Today I had a problem with that launching VS build from inside an ant script &amp;amp;#8211; a standard windows crash appeared with 0xc000005 error code and a &amp;amp;#8220;friendly&amp;amp;#8221; Send/Don&amp;amp;#8217;t send error to Microsoft dialog.

      <description>There are a few articles on the web describing how to load assemblies using reflection, thus allowing you to execute third-party code inside your own application. While applicable in most cases, my customer wanted those plugins to be replaceable on-the-fly. Keep mind that once an assembly has been loaded into an application domain it cannot be unloaded unless you unload the domain(which is you main app domain by default)=close the application.</description>

      <description>Being a &amp;#8216;mobile&amp;#8217; developer is definitely fun. Although sometimes, when you think about it &amp;#8216;deeper&amp;#8217; you&amp;#8217;d rather drink a pint of whiskey:). Take a look at the enterprise Symbian OS:  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/mobile/Symbian_OS_design_faults.aspx  Reliable, huh? 😉 And it&amp;#8217;s not just Symbian &amp;#8211; in my point of view it&amp;#8217;s MIDP itself. You just can&amp;#8217;t rely on it unless you test, test and once again &amp;#8211; test. For me it feels like implementation usually just do not care about about what does the specification say.</description>

Although my ‘more serious’ still reproduce this is something pleasant, indicating that the work is in progress and I’m sure all the other stuff will be fixed soon.</description>

First of all I’ve ran into an issue with ant Jar task. It refused to work with an ‘update’ option set to true. The interesting part of it was that executing the task independently didn’t cause any pain, but launching it in the sequence(multiple calls through different build scripts) caused ant to … hang.</description>

A few years before I Used this IDE for some projects and was very happy with it &amp;amp;#8211; consequent moving to eclipse disappointed me much. However time passed and I&amp;amp;#8217;ve got used to eclipse &amp;amp;#8211; it&amp;amp;#8217;s not a bad platform after all and it was free. So now when the free version idea came out I was very anxious convincing our customers to switch.</description>

      <description>Reading the developers guide on BlackBerry you may come across astonishing things. I’m impressed. When I started doing little things in the blackberry app I soon got used to it and considered the platform to be well organized. Now that I’m reading a book I get more and more confused about what I should do and what I shan’t! Take a look at this masterpiece

      <description>Continuing the BlackBerry theme would like to share a few more issues I’ve ran into recently.
 Internet usage.
If you subscribe to blackberry service you can optionally buy some “internet package” from your provider in order to minimize internet expenses. This a great choice since you’re going to visit internet pretty often if you’ve chosen blackberry. Everything goes fine until you start using Java apps on your phone. Java uses it OWN predefined internet connection DIFFERENT from the one the browser uses.</description>

      <description>Recently had an issue in the BlackBerry Java application: it was reported to crash if the sounds were on and played often. However it didn’t crash if sounds were played once in a while. After some investigation it turned out that there are no memory leaks but some thing blocked the event dispatch queue. I asked for help on Stack Overflow and BlackBerry developer forums but that didn’t lead me anywhere except that I thought that something definitely gets locked.</description>

      <description>One step forward to MCPD. To my mind there is not that much to pass in this exam(MCPD) &amp;amp;#8211; it&amp;amp;#8217;s like a combination of the previous 2 with some logic included- not just simple development components.  Regarding the exam – not much can be said. Only one thing is worth mentioning – it feels like not everything in this exam is covered by the training kit. Of course I can be wrong, but still feels like it is… Interesting how would the next one go…</description>

      <description>Recently(probably 2 moths ago, but still – recently) had to configure a bit of security for our test servers, visible to the web. Of course started with securing services under their own special accounts, limited to a very small amount of rights. Everything went on smoothly except one lil’ thing – it didn’t work:) All permissions were set correctly, all relationships assigned well, but services didn’t start. Resolution(found it in 2 hours) was fairly simple – while creating accounts for my services I forgot to check the “Password never expires” checkbox.</description>

It’s not that something awful happened, but potentially this is really serious. Imagine you have a template in the phone to send SMS quickly with predefined text. And Imagine this piece of software has bugs… Whatever – one might think if it won’t send an sms – I’ll retype and sent it again.</description>

I started with creating an new view of type javax.microedition.lcdui.List, keeping in mind that I can just construct it with List.EXCLUSIVE and add whatever items i want and everything should work fine. Well almost… All looked nice and the items showed up very attractively, having transparency and current font set up by default, which looked quite impressive.</description>

      <description>The nice thing about all Noka phones is that they simply work. No excuses. But seems like putting lts of effort into the phone firmware leaves very little to the supporting software these phones are shipped with. There is a really nice piece of software called “Nokia PC Suite”. Though it is 80% useless to my mind it has always been a pleasure for me to know I can manage utmost every feature in my phone throught that shiny UI.</description>

The first problem i stumbled upon was resources. eah yeah – i mean form resources. They ciompletely refused to work. I know about that separation that came in when VS 2005 was introduced so I did use DeCodEx to make majour conversion and splitting but it still turned out that my forms are not opening :(.</description>

      <description>About 3 years ago I wash introduced to CVS and from that time I havent stopped using it as it quickly became my daily useage tool. Since than I tried some different tools- just because i had to due to work purposes and one of them was Subversion(SVN). I [ractically don’t see any difference between the two in usage and moreover in the interface. It has to be said that I use TortoiseCVS/SVN verisons – maybe standalone apps differ significantly.</description>

Usability – good, except if one tab hangs – all tabs entire app hang…After some time however you get a dialog requesting the stop of some plugin, but in general – if there is no active items on the page – it just hangs 🙁</description>

What I am trying to say – if do everything right from the first time e.g. correctly choose all names and dialogs and files e.t.c it works perfectly. But when after 5 minutes you decide to change, say, some script or file destination WISE i making so many actions in background you can’t even imagine.</description>

      <description>Interesting things happen when you try to marshal something in real life….Even if you do not happen to dig into strange structure-marshalling: just a few methods or smth. strange problems may occur. For example marshalling char** for in and out usage. I was struggling for about a day for the code worked on developmnet environment and did not on test:). So the correct marshal is next [native] extern __declspec(dllexport) int SomeFunc(char** stringArray); [marshal]</description>

      <description>The previous post highlighted how to accomplish the given task using TIFF-PDF-JPEG-BITMAP conversion. Though this was is complicated it works perfect. But so much code for so little functionality often is not considered good if even eccepted. Recently a new way was found. It has to be said that it is not “the proper way”, because it needs some annatural code, but it is considerably lighter than the previous one. SO the idea is to draw direktly on the window using its HWND and SDK drawContentsToFunction.</description>

      <description>Today i would like to continue PDF plugins development theme. The next thing i was struggling with for about three days was displaying *TIFF ot *TIF images in Picture box control on he ADMDialog. Well nice thing is it can do this, bad thing is: not the way we think it should be. Unfortunately i havent found the other way as to convert image file to JPEG format(through PDF) and that load it as BITMAP which i could put into the ADMIconRef…Also i would like to admit that after loading the HBITMAP i had to resize it to the proper the of pcture box i had.</description>

      <description>Recently i was developing a feature for the Adobe(R) Acrobat Reader(R) plugin and come across an issue of selecting/highlighting annotations on the document based on some criteria e.g. if an annotation is positioned too close to the margin of the page… – bad you are :). Here i’ll post a tutorial like code for atchieving this goal for when trying to resolve that problem the only helpful information i foud was the Adobe Acrobat 7.</description>
