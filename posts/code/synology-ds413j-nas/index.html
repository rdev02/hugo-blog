But, to keep consistent with the previous review Iâ€™ll go with the same headings/experience areas. That being said â€“ here we go! DSJ413j Half a year has passed and Iâ€™ve been using Synology NAS for all this time. I ordered it from Amazon and off it came right in the delivery timeframes, ready for my experiments and scrutiny. Packaging and build quality. I couldnâ€™t be impressed more. Apple usually is a master in packaging their products, but these guys(synology) can stand up the competition. Everything in the box was perfectly packed a secured in a very little amount of space yet preserving a pleasant unpacking experience. One of the nice things is â€“ when I was moving I managed to pack it with the box I saved just as if it was never unpackaged. Somehow they thought out the packaging in a way you use all the parts, perfectly seal the device and accessories and you have no junk left:) â€“ KUDOS! Build is a step up from the aforementioned NAS. All the parts that were plastic in seagate are metallic in synology. The drive bay has 2 solid fans and the drives themselves are secured inside the bay with bolts. Accessing the drives is also not that easy â€“ you have to unscrew 4 bolts at the back, lower the back panel with fans and then get to the drives. This is not as convenient as seagateâ€™s open-dorr-click-and-take-away system, but how often do you actually want to replace drives inside your NAS? ðŸ˜‰ Other then that Synology is about the same size and noise, although heavier(due to metal parts). Move on to usage:) UI and Software. It comes with DSM 4.2. Usually, when you log into the web interface you would expect some semi-lame web app thatâ€™ll link you to the features of your device. Not the case! Not even close! DSM web interface if one of the most(in not just the most) advanced web interfaces Iâ€™ve ever seen. Itâ€™s all ajax and feels like a fine-tuned linux window manager. you literally have a web-like sort-of OS, working on your NAS giving you full control over it. Pages can be written about all the possibilities you have with the built in apps and thereâ€™s even more with thirds party packages. Literally, everything I might have thought/dreamed about that I could combine/use NAS for â€“ is already there. With a nice, multitasking, rich intuitive and responsive interface. I wonâ€™t go into much details about the apps â€“ thereâ€™s just too many of them to cover and each and every of them deserves good comments. Those who want to learn more â€“ I welcome you to use link I mentioned a couple lines up. In 6 months Iâ€™ve never seen any app crash or misbehave. Neither did I see any hardware faults or reboots. Stable. Reliable. The worx. I did the same tests, that I had done for the previous NAS. They all showed good consistent results, so I went on started configuring and placing my data on it. For some reason new apps did not want to install to second partition, so I had to use the first one for all the apps and the second one for all other stuff which was not my initial plan. Whatever. I checked the read/write speeds and they were almost at what the specs were saying. Later I tested out 2 simultanious clients accessing 1080p video from the device, while one other device was listing pictures from it. They all showed decent performance and that is probably the biggest load Iâ€™ll ever put on this device. So in general â€“ it worx:). The problems. I did not have them:) There was one problem I had not being able to set up Glacier backup from my NAS after I moved. But luckily they do have support forumsÂ which helped me understand that my time was not synchronized. After I fixed the time issue everything worked like a charm. Summary. pros: + build quality + realiability + software + configurability cons: â€“ pricey Bonus. It costs around 2.5 times more than seagate, but Iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth every penny I paid.
