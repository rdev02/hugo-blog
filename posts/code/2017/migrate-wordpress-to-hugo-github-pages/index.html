The things that I was looking for included:\nclean readable design/theme easy to use editor, preferably wysiwyg easy basics: tags, archive, search, comments, bio etc. After getting a closer look it turned out that Wordpress is a very bare-bones platform: plugins+themes are the things that make it beautiful and functional. I spent a lot of time looking for a functional simple free themes/plugins that would make my blog look readable on both mobile and desktop. I found one, but ultimately I wasn’t happy with it.

It comes with a fast server, that takes about 30 MB mem to run on site of this size(which is not large, but not exactly empty either). You write your posts in markdown, which is currently what I breathe, and you can literally program you pages(with go-like syntax), should you really want to. You need to keep in mind everything is static in the end, thus, should you want your site to be responsive, you’ll have to use javascript.\nHugo has support for most things you’d want to have: tags(taxonomies), categories, metadata, templates for different types of content, ready to use themes and internationalization support.

<p>The goal was to get my wordpress running on GitHub Pages, with a custom domain. I also prefer my content to be versioned separately from the framework, therefore I went with git worktrees workflow as described below.
<br><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As described <a href="https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/">here</a>, use the <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">exporter plugin</a> to get your content out of wordpress. <br>
I&rsquo;ve hit problems right there, on step one:<br>
<strong>Fatal error: Class &lsquo;ZipArchive&rsquo; not found in /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/hugo-export.php on line 403</strong>
<br>
<em>Solution</em>: make sure you have zip installed and enabled(in php.ini) on your machine. php info would be you guiding light. I was running an old <code>wordpress:4.6.1-fpm</code> bare container hence <code>apt-get</code> was useless. If you are in the same or similar boat that I was - upgrade to latest <code>wordpress:4.8.3-php7.0-fpm</code>  then use
<br><strong>docker-php-ext-install zip</strong><br>
inside the container. Restart the container - now it(export) should work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme">tranquipeak theme</a><br>
There were no problems for me doing this. Configuring the theme takes a while, especially if you decide to change fonts, highlights etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test everything works by running <code>hugo server</code> or <code>hugo</code> to generate files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now host the thing on GitHub Pages, using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">this guide</a><br>
I had several problems here where I could not select the branch to publish from on github, or my CNAME was not working. The remedy was to follow the steps and instructions <em><em>exactly</em></em> as prescribed by github, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the index.html page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your project to be GitHub pages in Settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull your project from GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have latest git installed and follow the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">guide</a><br>
I had a problem here where wit git worktree:
<code>fatal: Refusing to point HEAD outside of refs/</code>
solved, by updating to the latest git.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6 <em>Add CNAME file, containing your domain name to your gh-pages branch root</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profit!</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps people, should they have trouble. Also, if you have problems following these instructions - let me know in comments.</p>
<p>PS: In my NGinx:Varnish:NGinx:Php-fpm:MySQL Wordpress setup I went overzealous on the HSTS header</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Set HSTS to 365 days
add_header Strict-Transport-Security &#34;max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload&#34;;
</code></pre><p>So now people, that visited my blog a year ago, and haven&rsquo;t cleared their cache since, will be forced to https, which would yield nothing, since custom domains are not served through https yet from GitHub Pages. Oh well&hellip;</p>
