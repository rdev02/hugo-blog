      <description>Back in 2013 I got myself a Synology DS413j, which has proven to be a reliable companion for me though these 7 years. I used it for file backup, media streaming and as a TimeMachine destination pretty successfully. Any such station needs good drives to provide value, and drives, as many of us know, are pretty unreliable. In 7 years I replaced about 6: 2 were bad right after arrival, and another 4 went bad as the years went by.</description>
