      <description>In this post I go over my move to Unify router, over a top-of-the-line Asus one, even though I got a new one just about a month ago.
I used to like my Asus routers: they stroke a balance between performance, reliability user-friendliness and maintenance. &amp;ldquo;Balance&amp;rdquo; is a very important word here, because they did neither well. In fact, as my routing needs grew, even &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo; became an issue.
Commonly I&amp;rsquo;d need to run a couple networks: main network for all secure devices, guest network for, well, guests :), isolated guest network for all the non-US-made IoT thingies and one for gaming/mining/whatever.</description>
