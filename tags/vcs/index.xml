      <description>About 3 years ago I wash introduced to CVS and from that time I havent stopped using it as it quickly became my daily useage tool. Since than I tried some different tools- just because i had to due to work purposes and one of them was Subversion(SVN). I [ractically don’t see any difference between the two in usage and moreover in the interface. It has to be said that I use TortoiseCVS/SVN verisons – maybe standalone apps differ significantly.</description>
