      <description>Back in 2013 I got myself a Synology DS413j, which has proven to be a reliable companion for me though these 7 years. I used it for file backup, media streaming and as a TimeMachine destination pretty successfully. Any such station needs good drives to provide value, and drives, as many of us know, are pretty unreliable. In 7 years I replaced about 6: 2 were bad right after arrival, and another 4 went bad as the years went by.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I was rambling about Seagate BlackArmor and my sad experience with it. Apart from the sadness it also has my initial thoughts and requirements, so I won&amp;#8217;t duplicate them in this one. But, to keep consistent with the previous review I&amp;#8217;ll go with the same headings/experience areas. That being said &amp;#8211; here we go! DSJ413j Half a year has passed and I&amp;#8217;ve been using Synology NAS for all this time.</description>

      <description>So I decided that I&amp;#8217;m sick and tired of plugging in and out usb drives. Be it my tiny 16GB daily thumb drive, or store-it-all 2TB external seagate &amp;#8211; this is a pain&amp;#8230; And to make sure everything is stored you have to &amp;#8220;detach/remove&amp;#8221; them safely all the time. And than eventually you need more storage(or will need) and expanding this kind of solution means more devices OR significantly more money.</description>
