      <description>Amazing. Yes it was really amazing. I traveled with my darling Anya and I didn&amp;amp;#8217;t expect it that good especially keeping in mind that we had to go with a 4 star hotel. However it was really nice and if you consider going to Turkey with a low budget &amp;amp;#8211; I would recommend [Kosdere Exclusive][1](the place we stayed in). First thing I have to mention is our tour agency [Tez Tour][2].</description>
