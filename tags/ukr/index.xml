      <description>THEY ALL SUCK!!! a big deal.
I will start with the last one. Having just recovered from the flu I decided to go to the hospital in order to check if I&amp;#8217;ve totally recovered and that there is nothing &amp;#8220;under the hood&amp;#8221; which would strike me in the back in few days. The normal procedure here is to have a blood&amp;nbsp;analysis&amp;nbsp;and a few more tests. Step one &amp;#8211; find the doctor.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#8217;s funny sometimes how could absolutely non-officially connected news be linked&amp;nbsp;together so tightly that one couldn&amp;#8217;t even imagine. Today, reading the daily&amp;nbsp;news I came across an article describing the Barack Obama&amp;#8217;s attitude towards Ukrainian&amp;nbsp;sovereignty along with greetings regarding this year&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;day. Between the other it was stated there that &amp;#8220;USA won&amp;#8217;t abandon Ukraine on its way towards democratic future&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;. Nice words, always pleased to hear/read such things in the mediapress.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>Today visited Times. Was interested in one article about (RU+GBR)/UA. To hell the article. I read the comments. OMG.
 OMG again.   &amp;#8220;People, even something that you care for most (democracy?) does not give you the right to lie passionately and ignore facts and invent lies. BTW, Eduard Glushko &amp;#8211; if you are so much afraid of the The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it still can be repaired. Poland has to give back to Germany the territories they got after WW2.</description>
