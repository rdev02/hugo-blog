      <description>I really, really do not know if that&amp;#8217;s accidental or on-purpose and whether it&amp;#8217;s connected with the fact that Microsoft bought Skype, but this morning I received a wonderful email:
  Now 3 things about this:
1. I **am **a skype user.
2. Who the hell is Natalia??? And why, and when&amp;nbsp; and WTF?!
3. I love to use skype. It would be sad if this is the turning point.</description>

      <title>MCPD acquired.</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Finally. Now frankly &amp;#8211; preparing for MS exams while doing die-hard java is not a funny thing to do. NEVER practice such a combination&amp;#8230;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;About the exam &amp;#8211; it was better then the previous 2: it obeyed no rules:). What I mean here is that I could have skipped the preparation kit completely! Yes there were a few questions related to the book&amp;#8217;s content, BUT reading it is completely optional IMHO.</description>

      <title>Devenv crash from the command line.</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Those of you who use devenv for building VS solutions(although you are discouraged to here) might get into trouble if your solution has more than 1 project and it takes quite a time building both. Today I had a problem with that launching VS build from inside an ant script &amp;#8211; a standard windows crash appeared with 0xc000005 error code and a &amp;#8220;friendly&amp;#8221; Send/Don&amp;#8217;t send error to Microsoft dialog.</description>

      <title>MCTS acquired!</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;One step forward to MCPD. To my mind there is not that much to pass in this exam(MCPD) &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s like a combination of the previous 2 with some logic included- &amp;nbsp;not just simple development components.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Regarding the exam &amp;#8211; not much can be said. Only one thing is worth mentioning &amp;#8211; it feels like not everything in this exam is covered by the training kit. Of course I can be wrong, but still feels like it is&amp;#8230; Interesting how would the next one go&amp;#8230;</description>

You can&amp;#8217;t really work with all of that technology at once to keep all the names of classes and methods in your head, and the projects are swapping fast&amp;#8230; SO it took me more than a year to get from an idea of sitting an axam to actually passing it.</description>
