      <description>I really, really do not know if that‚Äôs accidental or on-purpose and whether it‚Äôs connected with the fact that Microsoft bought Skype, but this morning I received a wonderful email:
Now 3 things about this:
I **am **a skype user. Who the hell is Natalia??? And why, and when and WTF?! I love to use skype. It would be sad if this is the** turning point**. üôÅ </description>

      <description>Finally. Now frankly &amp;amp;#8211; preparing for MS exams while doing die-hard java is not a funny thing to do. NEVER practice such a combination&amp;amp;#8230; About the exam &amp;amp;#8211; it was better then the previous 2: it obeyed no rules:). What I mean here is that I could have skipped the preparation kit completely! Yes there were a few questions related to the book&amp;amp;#8217;s content, BUT reading it is completely optional IMHO.</description>

      <description>Those of you who use devenv for building VS solutions(although you are discouraged to [here][1]) might get into trouble if your solution has more than 1 project and it takes quite a time building both. Today I had a problem with that launching VS build from inside an ant script &amp;amp;#8211; a standard windows crash appeared with 0xc000005 error code and a &amp;amp;#8220;friendly&amp;amp;#8221; Send/Don&amp;amp;#8217;t send error to Microsoft dialog. Also I noticed that the VS cl.</description>

      <description>One step forward to MCPD. To my mind there is not that much to pass in this exam(MCPD) &amp;amp;#8211; it&amp;amp;#8217;s like a combination of the previous 2 with some logic included- not just simple development components. Regarding the exam ‚Äì not much can be said. Only one thing is worth mentioning ‚Äì it feels like not everything in this exam is covered by the training kit. Of course I can be wrong, but still feels like it is‚Ä¶ Interesting how would the next one go‚Ä¶</description>

You can‚Äôt really work with all of that technology at once to keep all the names of classes and methods in your head, and the projects are swapping fast‚Ä¶ SO it took me more than a year to get from an idea of sitting an axam to actually passing it.</description>
