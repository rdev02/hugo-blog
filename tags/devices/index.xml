      <description>My series 4 apple watch was purchased something like 4 years ago, just to help with running. With the release of the new Ultra and the battery on my trusty friend starting to show signs of wear, I was seriously considering an upgrade. That was, until a great deal on a Garmin 6s watch swooped in and I &amp;ldquo;took a bite&amp;rdquo;.
This post serves as a recount my personal experience with the two, since they are truly different devices.</description>
