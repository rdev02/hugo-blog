      <description>Once the Apple Vision Pro became available I instantly ordered it to test out 3 use cases:
work monitor: use headset to be able to work in any place/condition with a comfortable large monitor gaming device: use headset as a streaming gaming platform anywhere personal IMAX: use headset to have unmatched movie-viewing experience anywhere. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on and off for about 3 weeks now. This post summarizes how it went for me.</description>

      <description>My series 4 apple watch was purchased something like 4 years ago, just to help with running. With the release of the new Ultra and the battery on my trusty friend starting to show signs of wear, I was seriously considering an upgrade. That was, until a great deal on a Garmin 6s watch swooped in and I &amp;ldquo;took a bite&amp;rdquo;.
This post serves as a recount my personal experience with the two, since they are truly different devices.</description>
