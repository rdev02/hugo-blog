      <description>Now seriously smth HAS to be done about Ukrainian girls reputation in Europe and generally throughout the world. Now I can‚Äôt speak for whole Ukraine but it seems to me that at least Western Ukraine girls are not that money-loving. Today walking to work I saw this
  All this stuff means &amp;#8220;I am a wealthy entrepreneur from USA looking for a nice whore wife from Ukraine aging 19-27&amp;#8243;. Now I&amp;#8217;ve seen this in newspapers and message boards etc.</description>

      <description>THEY ALL SUCK!!! a big deal.
I will start with the last one. Having just recovered from the flu I decided to go to the hospital in order to check if I‚Äôve totally recovered and that there is nothing ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù which would strike me in the back in few days. The normal procedure here is to have a blood analysis and a few more tests. Step one ‚Äì find the doctor.</description>

      <description>Amazing. Yes it was really amazing. I traveled with my darling Anya and I didn&amp;amp;#8217;t expect it that good especially keeping in mind that we had to go with a 4 star hotel. However it was really nice and if you consider going to Turkey with a low budget &amp;amp;#8211; I would recommend [Kosdere Exclusive][1](the place we stayed in). First thing I have to mention is our tour agency [Tez Tour][2].</description>

      <description>It&amp;amp;#8217;s funny sometimes how could absolutely non-officially connected news be linked together so tightly that one couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t even imagine. Today, reading the daily news I came across an article describing the Barack Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s attitude towards Ukrainian &amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-family: -webkit-monospace;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;sovereignty along with greetings regarding this year&amp;amp;#8217;s independence day. Between the other it was stated there that &amp;amp;#8220;USA won&amp;amp;#8217;t abandon Ukraine on its way towards democratic future&amp;amp;#8230;&amp;amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Today visited Times. Was interested in one article about (RU+GBR)/UA. To hell the article. I read the comments. OMG.
 OMG again.   &amp;#8220;People, even something that you care for most (democracy?) does not give you the right to lie passionately and ignore facts and invent lies. BTW, Eduard Glushko &amp;#8211; if you are so much afraid of the The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it still can be repaired. Poland has to give back to Germany the territories they got after WW2.</description>
